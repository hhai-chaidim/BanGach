## Overview

**BanGach** is a simple **brick-breaking (Breakout-style)** game created with **Java**.  
The player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break all the bricks on the screen without letting the ball fall.  
This project is designed to practice basic **Java OOP**, **graphics (Swing/AWT)**, and **game loop** implementation.

---

## Game Concept

- The game window displays a paddle, ball, and multiple rows of bricks.  
- The player uses the keyboard to move the paddle left and right.  
- Each time the ball hits a brick, that brick disappears, and the player earns points.  
- The game ends when:
  - All bricks are destroyed (you win ðŸŽ‰)
  - The ball falls below the paddle (you lose ðŸ’€)
